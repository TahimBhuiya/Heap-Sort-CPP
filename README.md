# Heap Sort in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Heap Sort** algorithm, an efficient comparison-based sorting method that uses a binary heap data structure:

1. Builds a **max-heap** from the input array.
2. Repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the array.
