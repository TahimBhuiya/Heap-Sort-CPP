# Heap Sort in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Heap Sort** algorithm, an efficient comparison-based sorting method that uses a binary heap data structure:

1. Builds a **max-heap** from the input array.
2. Repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the array.
3. Maintains the heap property after each extraction to continue sorting.

It displays the array before and after sorting to help visualize how heap sort organizes the elements.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Heap Data Structure**: Uses a max-heap to efficiently find the largest element.
- **In-Place Sorting**: Requires only a small, constant amount of extra memory.
- **Efficient Performance**: Time complexity of _O(n log n)_ in all cases.
- **Fully Commented Code**: Clear explanations for each step of the algorithm.

## ðŸ“‹ Example Run

**Input:**
Original array:
12 11 13 5 6 7

**Output:**
Sorted array:
5 6 7 11 12 13
